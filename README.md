# Budget Tracker

Budget Tracker does exactly what the title says. It allows you to track your budget by adding and subtracting money. 

Since tracking your money is extremely important, you don't want any misshaps due to bad connectivity. That's why Budget Tracker keeps track of your inputs
even OFFLINE!!! If you're curious as to how this works, review the service-worker.js, and idb.js files.
